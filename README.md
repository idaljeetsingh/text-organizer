# Text Organizer & Fetcher

A powerful, cross-platform desktop application to organize frequently used text snippets, assign global hotkeys, and securely fetch text from your mobile device's clipboard.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🖥️ Desktop Text Organizer
*   **5+ Dynamic Rows:** Store frequently used text (emails, code snippets, templates).
*   **Global Hotkeys:** Assign custom shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+1`) to auto-type text into *any* active application.
*   **Password Mode:** Toggle visibility for sensitive data.
*   **Secure PIN Protection:** Set a master PIN to lock/unlock password fields.
*   **Encrypted Storage:** All data is AES-256 encrypted and bound to your specific machine hardware.

### 📱 Mobile Text Fetch
*   **Seamless Transfer:** Scan a QR code to instantly send text from your phone's clipboard to the desktop app.
*   **Direct to Clipboard:** Option to fetch text directly to your computer's clipboard without saving it to a row.
*   **Secure Connection:** Uses a local HTTPS server with self-signed certificates to ensure secure transfer.
*   **One-Time Sessions:** Each QR code is valid for a single use only, preventing replay attacks.

### 🛡️ Security & Privacy
*   **Local Only:** No cloud servers. All data stays on your local network and machine.
*   **Hardware Binding:** Encrypted data file which cannot be decrypted if copied to another computer.
*   **Smart Typing:** Password fields are typed out character-by-character to avoid clipboard history leaks.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   A mobile device on the same Wi-Fi network.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd text-fetch
```

This will launch the desktop interface.

### Using Hotkeys

2.  Click the "Shortcut" box and press your desired key combination (e.g., `Alt+Shift+T`).
3.  Switch to any other app (Notepad, Browser, etc.).
4.  Press the shortcut to auto-type the text.

### Fetching from Mobile
1.  Click the **Phone Icon** next to a row (or "Clipboard" button at the bottom).
2.  Scan the QR code with your phone's camera.
3.  Open the link (accept the "Self-Signed Certificate" warning if prompted).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

*   **"Site can't be reached" on Mobile:** Ensure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network. Check if your firewall is blocking port `8001`.
*   **Hotkeys stopped working:** Click the **Settings (Gear Icon) -> Reload Hotkeys** to refresh the keyboard hooks.
*   **Garbage text when typing:** The app tries to release modifier keys automatically. If issues persist, try releasing keys faster after pressing the shortcut.
